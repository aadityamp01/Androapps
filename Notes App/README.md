# Notes-App

It's an android Notes App, where we can add notes which will be stored  in the database and will be displayed in a recycler view.
We can update and delete a note, just by clicking on the note from the list.

## Libraries Used

* [Kotlin][1] - Kotlin is a Modern, concise and safe programming language. 
* [View Binding][2] - View binding is a feature that allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
* [Lifecycles][3] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
* [LiveData][4] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
* [ViewModel][7] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
