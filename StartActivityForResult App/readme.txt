What is StartActivityForResult

By the help of android startActivityForResult() method, we can send information from one activity to another and vice-versa. 
The android startActivityForResult method, requires a result from the second activity (activity to be invoked).

In such case, we need to override the onActivityResult method that is invoked automatically when second activity returns result.
