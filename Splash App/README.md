### What is Splash Screen?

A Splash Screen is a screen that appears when you open an app on your mobile device. 
Sometimes it’s referred to as a launch screen or startup screen and shows up when your app is loading after you’ve just opened it.
When the loading is finished, you’ll be taken to a more functional screen where you can complete actions.

Splash screens appear on your screen for a fleeting moment — look away and you might miss them. 
The splash screen is one of the most vital screens in the application since it’s the user’s first experience with the application.
